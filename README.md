# TIC-TAC-TOE-Game
It's a simple Tic Tac Toe game that has been created by using the python programming.
Run the script in a Python environment, such as IDLE or Jupyter Notebook, to begin playing the game. You will be asked to input a number between 1 and 9 in order to set your marker when the board has been shown. The following spots on the board match the numbers:
1 | 2 | 3
---------
4 | 5 | 6
---------
7 | 8 | 9
Any number between 1 and 9 can be entered, and the associated marker will be put on the board. The game goes on until someone wins or a draw results.
